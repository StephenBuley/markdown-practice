# Automation Ideas

## Setup

- I want to be able to import events easily into the event tracker so that I don't have to go through and put everything in one by one.
  - I need to get the data from each event in the calendar
  - Then I need to take that data from each event and make it into a spreadsheet
  - Then I need to take the spreadsheet and put the things into the list.
  - All of that sounds really hard, and I don't even know if I can do that.

## Event Tracker

- I need to figure out what columns I actually need.
- To do that, I need to decide the functionality now of what I want this to do in the first place

## Functionality

- I want to be able to generate the following reports
  - BER
  - NAVCO
  - PAO SIGACTS
  - CONGEN Report
- I want to be able to give out these notifications
  - When an event is created, notify the unit leader
  - When an event status is updated, notify the unit leader
  - When the event created is a travel trip, notify Passports and Travel POs
- I want different people to be able to update and/or see different things
  - There needs to be a calendar generated and updated through the tracker
  - Travel needs to be able to update the status of the travel arrangements, funding, that sort of thing.
  - ULs need to be able to quickly and easily input the after action information
  - I want everyone in the U.S. Naval Forces Europe and Africa Band Team to be able to see the tracker and the resulting calendar but not edit anything. Only if they are in the Ops group

## Meetings

- I want to figure out how close this civilian guy is to creating something worthwhile.
- I need to set something up between civilian and command, and possibly include IT people
- I need to be able to teach this to everyone
- Somehow I need to do all of this while also doing all the rest of my job.

## Plan of Action

- Start slow: see if you can export the calendar as a CSV, and go from there on importing the rest of the stuff.
- Get started: From now on, have everyone try to start using the tracker. See if that will work and try to make it happen.
- Test attachments to see if they get created on a calendar event
- Think about this: should this be multiple sharepoint lists that all talk to each other? Is that even a good idea?
